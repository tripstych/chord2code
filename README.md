The GUI is fairly self explanatory.

Only tested on Windows -  PySimpleGUI, PyGame and keyboard are the only requirements though, OS X and Linux should work.. we'll see about Ubuntu shortly at least.

TODO: 
Service only baked version, sans GUI apart from start/stop and MIDI device selection
Windows executable(s) - other finicky things.  Who knows? 

Suggestions, comments, bug reports, etc are welcome and appreciated.

# chord2code

Ever been using your DAW with your QWERTY sitting just out of reach or awkwardly positioned and you need to hit that special key on it
while you've got 88 black & white ones directly under your finger tips - just staring at you, mocking you and the futility of collaborative behaviour between corporations in a pre-galatic era [Sir be Sirius not].   

It doesn't matter how good your MIDI controller is, it's not going to press F2!  

Ever think - Wouldn't'd be great if it would just press 'R' and 'space' when I hit this ... disharmonic chord I'd never play normally? or whatever?

Me too.

The GUI is fairly self explanatory.

Only tested on Windows, Python 3.8 (any 3. should be a-ok) -  
PySimpleGUI, PyGame and keyboard are the only requirements
So, OS X, Linux and.. who knows may work.. the more popular the more likely

we'll see about Ubuntu shortly at least... 

TODO: 
Service only baked version, sans GUI apart from start/stop and MIDI device selection
Windows executable(s) for the lay - other finicky things.  Who knows? 

Suggestions, comments, bug reports, etc are welcome and appreciated.

The GUI is fairly self explanatory.

Only tested on Windows, Python 3.8 (any 3. should be a-ok) -  
PySimpleGUI, PyGame and keyboard are the only requirements
So, OS X, Linux and.. who knows may work.. the more popular the more likely

we'll see about Ubuntu shortly at least... 

TODO: 
Service only baked version, sans GUI apart from start/stop and MIDI device selection
Windows executable(s) for the lay - other finicky things.  Who knows? 

Suggestions, comments, bug reports, etc are welcome and appreciated.
